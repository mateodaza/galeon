GPL-FREE VERIFIER PLAN:

To keep the entire contracts package Apache-2.0 compatible, we can:

1. Use Hardcaml-ZK verifiers (MIT licensed)
   - https://github.com/hardcaml/hardcaml_zk
   - Generates Solidity verifiers with MIT license

2. Use Gnark verifiers (Apache-2.0)
   - https://github.com/Consensys/gnark
   - Requires recompiling circuits in Go

3. Write custom Groth16 verifier (Apache-2.0)
   - The verifier logic is just BN254 pairing operations
   - Can write from scratch using EIP-196/197 precompiles
   - Template available: https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/issues/152

4. Use Halo2 (Apache-2.0)
   - No trusted setup required
   - Different proof system, would require circuit rewrite

Recommended: Option 3 - Write a custom Apache-2.0 verifier template.
The core logic is ~200 lines of Solidity calling bn256 precompiles.
Only the verification key constants differ per circuit.
