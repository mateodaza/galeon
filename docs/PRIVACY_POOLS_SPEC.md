# Galeon Privacy Pools Specification

> Compliant Privacy Mixing for Private Payments

> ⚠️ **Architecture Update (Jan 2026):** References to "fog wallets" in this spec are outdated.
> The current architecture uses **direct Pool withdrawals**:
>
> - Port → Pool (deposit) → Recipient (withdraw with ZK proof)
> - No intermediate fog wallets - withdrawals go directly to payment recipients
> - See [FOG-SHIPWRECK-PLAN.md](./FOG-SHIPWRECK-PLAN.md) for the updated implementation plan

## Overview

Privacy Pools is a mixing protocol that allows Galeon users to break the link between receiving and sending payments, while maintaining full compliance capability.

**Key Innovation**: Port-only deposits mean all funds are "pre-vetted" - they came from covenant signers paying each other.

**The Galeon Covenant**: Users sign a compliance agreement to join, creating a self-policing community of good actors.

**Core Principle**: Privacy from the public, not from law enforcement.

---

## Compliance Architecture Summary

### The Galeon Trust Model (Explicit)

**What Galeon CAN See/Do:**

- All Port payments (viewing key escrow → scan announcements)
- Link commitments to depositors (`commitmentDepositor` mapping)
- Block future deposits from flagged addresses
- Exclude commitments from valid set (freeze withdrawals)
- IP logs, covenant signatures, fog wallet metadata (if stored)

**What Galeon CANNOT See/Do:**

- Spend user funds (no spending keys)
- Link withdrawal to deposit (ZK proof hides which commitment)
- See withdrawal destination (stealth address, no viewing key)
- Modify Merkle tree after deposit (immutable)

| Layer    | Privacy From Public      | Privacy From Galeon                                   | Freeze Capability             |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Port** | ✅ Yes (stealth address) | ❌ No (viewing key escrow)                            | ❌ No (user has spending key) |
| **Pool** | ✅ Yes (ZK proofs)       | ✅ Partial (can't trace withdrawal, CAN link deposit) | ✅ Yes (exclusion set)        |

> **User Understanding**: Users should know Galeon is NOT a trustless protocol. It's "privacy from public + compliance capability" not "privacy from everyone."

---

### Port-Only Deposit Enforcement (Concrete Mechanism)

**Problem**: Stealth addresses don't inherently prove they came from a Port payment.

**Solution**: GaleonRegistry tracks all stealth addresses that received payments:

```solidity
// In GaleonRegistry.payNative():
isPortStealthAddress[stealthAddress] = true;
verifiedBalance[stealthAddress] += netAmount;

// In GaleonPrivacyPool.deposit():
require(
    galeonRegistry.isValidPortAddress(msg.sender),
    "Depositor must be a Port stealth address"
);
require(
    msg.value <= galeonRegistry.getVerifiedBalance(msg.sender),
    "Amount exceeds verified balance"
);

// Deduct from verified balance to prevent double-deposit
galeonRegistry.consumeVerifiedBalance(msg.sender, msg.value);
```

**Flow:**

```
1. Payer → GaleonRegistry.payNative() → stealth address receives 1 MNT
   └── Registry records: isPortStealthAddress[stealth] = true
   └── Registry records: verifiedBalance[stealth] = 1 MNT

2. Stealth owner → GaleonPrivacyPool.deposit(commitment)
   └── Pool checks: galeonRegistry.isValidPortAddress(msg.sender) ✅
   └── Pool checks: msg.value <= verifiedBalance[msg.sender] ✅
   └── Registry decrements: verifiedBalance[stealth] -= 1 MNT
   └── Pool records: commitmentDepositor[commitment] = msg.sender

3. Attacker sends dirty MNT directly to stealth address
   └── verifiedBalance stays at 0 (not from GaleonRegistry)
   └── Stealth can't deposit dirty funds (exceeds verifiedBalance)
```

**Edge Case - Direct Sends:**
If someone sends MNT directly to a stealth address (not via GaleonRegistry):

- `verifiedBalance` is NOT incremented
- User can spend those funds normally (collect, send)
- User CANNOT deposit them to Privacy Pool
- This is the intended behavior (only "clean" funds in pool)

### ASP/Exclusion System (Following 0xbow Pattern)

**0xbow Model**: Uses separate Association Sets (valid depositors vs excluded depositors), NOT Merkle tree pruning.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Galeon Implementation:**

```solidity
// ASP-controlled exclusion (does NOT modify Merkle tree)
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public excludedCommitments;
bytes32 public aspRoot; // Root of valid association set

event CommitmentExcluded(bytes32 indexed commitment, string reason);
event CommitmentReincluded(bytes32 indexed commitment);

/// @notice ASP excludes a commitment (freeze)
function excludeCommitment(bytes32 commitment, string calldata reason) external onlyASP {
    require(commitments[commitment], "Commitment not in pool");
    require(!excludedCommitments[commitment], "Already excluded");

    excludedCommitments[commitment] = true;
    exclusions[commitment] = Exclusion({
        excluded: true,
        excludedAt: block.timestamp,
        amount: DENOMINATION,
        depositor: commitmentDepositor[commitment]
    });

    // Update ASP root (recalculate valid set)
    _updateASPRoot();

    emit CommitmentExcluded(commitment, reason);
}

/// @notice Withdrawal must prove membership in BOTH trees
function withdraw(
    bytes calldata merkleProof,    // Proves: commitment in deposit tree
    bytes calldata aspProof,       // Proves: commitment in valid set
    bytes32 root,
    bytes32 aspRoot_,
    bytes32 nullifierHash,
    address payable recipient,
    ...
) external {
    // Verify merkle membership (deposit tree - immutable)
    require(isKnownRoot(root), "Invalid merkle root");

    // Verify ASP membership (valid set - mutable)
    require(aspRoot_ == aspRoot, "Invalid ASP root");
    require(!excludedCommitments[commitment], "Commitment excluded");

    // ... rest of withdrawal logic
}
```

**Why This Doesn't Break Proofs:**

- Merkle tree is NEVER modified → old proofs still valid for membership
- ASP root is separate → exclusion only affects ASP proof
- Innocent users regenerate ASP proof with new root (simple)
- Excluded users can't generate valid ASP proof (blocked)

---

### Stealth-Only Withdrawals + Relayer Considerations

**Problem Without Relayer:**

```
1. User wants to withdraw to fresh stealth address
2. Fresh address has 0 MNT (can't pay gas)
3. User must fund it from somewhere → linkage leak!

Options without relayer:
a) Fund from exchange → links exchange account to stealth
b) Fund from existing wallet → links wallets
c) Use Pool withdrawal gas from another address → still needs funding
```

**Solution: Relayer Support (Future)**

```solidity
function withdraw(
    bytes calldata proof,
    bytes32 root,
    bytes32 nullifierHash,
    address payable recipient,
    address relayer,           // Relayer pays gas
    uint256 relayerFee         // Relayer compensation (from withdrawal)
) external {
    // ... verification ...

    uint256 protocolFee = (DENOMINATION * withdrawalFeeBps) / 10000;
    uint256 netAmount = DENOMINATION - protocolFee - relayerFee;

    // Pay relayer (covers their gas cost + profit)
    if (relayer != address(0) && relayerFee > 0) {
        payable(relayer).transfer(relayerFee);
    }

    // Pay protocol fee
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
        payable(treasury).transfer(protocolFee);
    }

    // Pay recipient
    payable(recipient).transfer(netAmount);
}
```

**Hackathon Scope:**

- ❌ No relayer (users must self-fund stealth addresses)
- ⚠️ Document linkage risk in UI: "Funding this address may reduce privacy"
- ✅ Contract supports relayer parameter (ready for future)

**Future Relayer Network:**

- Decentralized relayers compete on fees
- User generates proof locally, sends to relayer
- Relayer submits tx, receives fee from withdrawal
- No linkage between user's funding source and stealth address

### Revenue/Freeze Interaction (Detailed)

**Scenario: User deposits 1 MNT, gets excluded, then appeals**

```
Timeline:
Day 0:   User deposits 1 MNT, commitment C created
Day 5:   ASP excludes commitment C (flagged as bad actor)
Day 10:  User appeals exclusion
Day 35:  Appeal period ends (30 days from exclusion)
Day 36:  Treasury can claim frozen funds

Fee handling:
- No withdrawal fee charged (user never withdrew)
- No donation collected (user never withdrew)
- Full 1 MNT goes to treasury (minus gas)
```

**Contract Implementation:**

```solidity
struct Exclusion {
    bool excluded;
    uint256 excludedAt;
    uint256 amount;          // Frozen amount (DENOMINATION)
    address depositor;       // Original depositor
    bool appealed;           // Appeal filed
    bool appealResolved;     // Appeal decision made
    bool appealGranted;      // If true, funds returned to depositor
}

uint256 public constant APPEAL_PERIOD = 30 days;

/// @notice Claim frozen funds after appeal period (treasury only)
function claimFrozenFunds(bytes32 commitment) external {
    Exclusion storage exc = exclusions[commitment];

    require(exc.excluded, "Not excluded");
    require(!exc.appealGranted, "Appeal was granted");
    require(
        block.timestamp >= exc.excludedAt + APPEAL_PERIOD,
        "Appeal period not ended"
    );
    require(!frozenFundsClaimed[commitment], "Already claimed");

    frozenFundsClaimed[commitment] = true;

    // NO withdrawal fee on frozen funds (punitive, not service)
    // Full amount to treasury
    payable(treasury).transfer(exc.amount);

    emit FrozenFundsClaimed(commitment, exc.amount);
}

/// @notice Grant appeal - return funds to depositor
function grantAppeal(bytes32 commitment) external onlyASP {
    Exclusion storage exc = exclusions[commitment];

    require(exc.excluded, "Not excluded");
    require(exc.appealed, "No appeal filed");
    require(!exc.appealResolved, "Already resolved");

    exc.appealResolved = true;
    exc.appealGranted = true;
    exc.excluded = false;

    // Re-add to valid set
    _updateASPRoot();

    // User can now withdraw normally (with fees)
    emit AppealGranted(commitment);
}
```

**Fee Rules:**
| Scenario | Protocol Fee | Donation | Recipient |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Normal withdrawal | 0.3% | Optional | User |
| Frozen → Treasury claim | 0% | N/A | Treasury |
| Frozen → Appeal granted | 0.3% (on eventual withdraw) | Optional | User |

| **Frozen Fund Recovery** | Treasury | N/A       | N/A        | N/A          | Unclaimed frozen funds after appeal  |

### Fee Parameters (Configurable by Owner/Governance)

```solidity
// GaleonRegistry fee parameters
uint256 public portCreationFee;      // Hackathon: 0, Production: 0.01 MNT
uint256 public paymentFeeBps;        // Hackathon: 0, Production: 0

// GaleonPrivacyPool fee parameters
uint256 public withdrawalFeeBps;     // Hackathon: 0, Production: 30 (0.3%)
uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_BPS = 500; // 5% max (protect users)

// Treasury
address public treasury;             // Receives all fees and donations
```

> **Hackathon Strategy**: All fees set to 0 for maximum adoption. Fee collection code is ready but disabled - flip switch for production.

### Revenue Collection Points

```
1. PORT CREATION (GaleonRegistry)
   └── User pays portCreationFee → Treasury

2. PAYMENT (GaleonRegistry.payNative)
   └── Fee: paymentFeeBps of amount → Treasury
   └── Optional: User adds donation → Treasury

3. POOL WITHDRAWAL (GaleonPrivacyPool.withdraw)
   └── Fee: withdrawalFeeBps of amount → Treasury
   └── Optional: User adds donation → Treasury

4. FROZEN FUND RECOVERY (GaleonPrivacyPool.claimFrozenFunds)
   └── Full amount after appeal period → Treasury
```

### Launch Strategy (Hackathon → Production)

| Phase             | Port Fee     | Payment Fee | Withdraw Fee | Notes               |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **Hackathon**     | 0 MNT        | 0%          | 0%           | Maximum adoption    |
| **Beta**          | 0 MNT        | 0%          | 0.1%         | Test fee collection |
| **Production v1** | 0.01 MNT     | 0%          | 0.3%         | Sustainable revenue |
| **Future**        | Configurable | 0.1%?       | 0.3%         | DAO governance      |

### Donation Integration (Optional Tips)

Users can optionally donate to Galeon treasury at key moments:

```solidity
// In GaleonPrivacyPool.withdraw
function withdraw(
    bytes calldata proof,
    ...
    uint256 donationBps  // 0 = no donation, user can choose 1-1000 (0.01%-10%)
) external {
    uint256 amount = DENOMINATION;
    uint256 fee = (amount * withdrawalFeeBps) / 10000;
    uint256 donation = (amount * donationBps) / 10000;
    uint256 netAmount = amount - fee - donation;

    // Transfer
    treasury.transfer(fee + donation);
    recipient.transfer(netAmount);

    emit Withdrawn(..., fee, donation);
}
```

### Revenue Projections (Example)

| Scenario  | Monthly Volume | Withdraw Fee (0.3%) | Monthly Revenue |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Hackathon | 100 MNT        | $0                  | $0              |
| Early     | 10,000 MNT     | $30                 | ~$30            |
| Growth    | 100,000 MNT    | $300                | ~$300           |
| Scale     | 1M MNT         | $3,000              | ~$3,000         |

_Note: Donations are upside - even 1% average donation rate doubles revenue_

## Implementation: Fork 0xbow (v1)

### Decision: Fork 0xbow Instead of Building v0

**Why 0xbow:**

- Vitalik Buterin deposited 1 ETH and invested in pre-seed
- Ethereum Foundation integrating into Kohaku wallet
- $6M+ volume, 1,500+ users since March 2025 mainnet launch
- $3.5M seed (Coinbase Ventures)
- Production-tested Groth16 circuits + ASP system
- BN254 curve is native on Mantle (EIP-196/197)

**What We Keep from 0xbow:**

- Groth16 ZK proofs (Poseidon hash, BN254 curve)
- Merkle tree of deposits (depth 20)
- Nullifier-based double-spend prevention
- Full ASP system

**What We Add (Galeon-specific):**

- Port-only deposits (covenant compliance)
- Stealth-only withdrawals (EIP-5564 integration)
- Galeon Covenant integration

| Component         | v1 Implementation (0xbow Fork)  | Future Upgrades                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Pool Deposits** | Port addresses only             | Add external deposits with chain analysis |
| **ASP**           | 0xbow ASP system + ban list     | DAO governance + chain analysis APIs      |
| **Shipwreck**     | Owner-only reports              | Community reporting with reputation       |
| **ZK Proofs**     | Groth16 (0xbow circuits)        | Multi-denomination pools                  |
| **Withdrawals**   | To registered stealth addresses | Add relayer for gas-free withdrawals      |

## The Galeon Covenant

### Core Concept

> "Private payments for good actors."

When users join Galeon, they sign the **Galeon Covenant** - a cryptographic agreement that:

1. Attests they're not a bad actor
2. Commits to reporting if they discover bad actors
3. Accepts that Galeon may exclude violators

**This is the "catch"** - you can't just use the privacy pool anonymously. You must sign in.

### Why This Works

### Covenant Data Structure

```typescript
// EIP-712 Typed Data for Covenant Signature
const COVENANT_TYPES = {
  GaleonCovenant: [
    { name: 'signer', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'stealthMetaAddress', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'attestations', type: 'Attestations' },
    { name: 'version', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'timestamp', type: 'uint256' },
  ],
  Attestations: [
    { name: 'notSanctioned', type: 'bool' },
    { name: 'fundsLegitimate', type: 'bool' },
    { name: 'willReport', type: 'bool' },
    { name: 'acceptsTerms', type: 'bool' },
  ],
}

interface GaleonCovenant {
  // Identity
  signer: `0x${string}` // Main wallet address
  stealthMetaAddress: string // Their st:mnt:... address

  // Attestations (all must be true to sign)
  attestations: {
    notSanctioned: true // "I'm not on OFAC/UN/EU sanctions lists"
    fundsLegitimate: true // "My funds are not from illegal activities"
    willReport: true // "I'll report if I discover my counterparty is bad"
    acceptsTerms: true // "I accept Galeon's terms and exclusion rights"
  }

  // Metadata
  version: 1 // Covenant version (for upgrades)
  timestamp: number // When signed (Unix ms)

  // The signature
  signature: `0x${string}` // EIP-712 typed signature
}
```

### Covenant Storage

| Location     | Data                      | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| On-chain     | `covenantHash`            | Proof user signed (can't deny later) |
| Backend      | Full covenant + signature | Verification, legal compliance       |
| LocalStorage | Signature only            | Quick re-verification                |

### Covenant On-Chain Storage (Integrated in GaleonRegistry)

> **Design Decision:** Covenant storage is integrated into `GaleonRegistry`, not a separate contract.
> This reduces deployment complexity, gas costs, and simplifies the architecture.

Covenant functionality is added directly to GaleonRegistry (see full contract below).

### User Acquisition Channels

| User Type           | Motivation                     | Entry Point            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Freelancers         | Private payments from clients  | Payment link           |
| Privacy enthusiasts | Maximum transaction privacy    | Privacy Pool           |
| DAOs                | Anonymous contributor payments | Port creation          |
| Businesses          | Compliant payroll privacy      | Covenant = audit trail |
| Crypto natives      | Hide wallet balances           | Fog wallets            |

### The "Catch" That Makes It Work

> **You must sign the Covenant to use Galeon.**

This means:

1. **No anonymous bad actors** - Everyone has signed identity on record
2. **Self-policing community** - Users report suspicious activity
3. **Regulatory defensibility** - "We require compliance attestation"
4. **Pool survival** - Unlike Tornado, we can exclude bad actors

---

## Shipwreck Reporting System

### What is Shipwreck?

"Shipwreck" is Galeon's compliance and reporting system. The metaphor:

- **Ships** = Transactions in the privacy pool
- **Wrecks** = Bad actors discovered and excluded
- **Lighthouse** = The reporting system that protects the fleet

### Report Types

```typescript
type ShipwreckReportType =
  | 'suspected_stolen' // Funds may be from theft/hack
  | 'counterparty_admitted' // Other party revealed illicit source
  | 'sanctions_match' // Address matches sanctions list
  | 'chain_analysis' // On-chain patterns suggest illicit
  | 'legal_request' // Law enforcement request
  | 'other' // Custom reason
```

## Compliance & Law Enforcement Cooperation

### The Doxxing Capability

> **Privacy is not anonymity. Galeon provides privacy from the public, not from law enforcement.**

When required by law or for confirmed bad actors, Galeon can reveal user identity through multiple mechanisms:

### What We Retain (Compliance Data)

| Data Type                      | Stored Where        | Links To                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Covenant Signature**         | On-chain + Backend  | Signer EOA address        |
| **Stealth Meta Address**       | Covenant registry   | EOA that generated it     |
| **Port Registrations**         | Backend database    | EOA + meta address        |
| **Fog Wallet Derivation Path** | Backend (encrypted) | Master signature hash     |
| **Pool Deposits**              | On-chain            | Source address (Port/EOA) |
| **Pool Withdrawals**           | On-chain            | Recipient stealth address |
| **Shipwreck Reports**          | Backend             | Reporter + subject        |
| **IP Addresses**               | Backend logs        | All actions (optional)    |

### Identity Resolution Chain

│  │  EOA can be traced through:                                       │ │

### Law Enforcement Request Process

```typescript
interface LawEnforcementRequest {
  // Request metadata
  id: string
  requestedAt: number
  requestingAgency: string // "FBI", "SEC", "Europol", etc.
  jurisdiction: string // "US", "EU", etc.
  legalBasis: string // Court order reference, subpoena ID

  // Target information
  targetType: 'address' | 'transaction' | 'meta_address' | 'port_name'
  targetValue: string // The address/tx/name being investigated

  // What they want
  requestedData: (
    | 'identity' // Covenant signer address
    | 'transaction_history' // All pool deposits/withdrawals
    | 'linked_addresses' // All stealth addresses from same meta
    | 'port_registry' // Port registration details
    | 'ip_logs' // IP addresses (if retained)
    | 'full_disclosure' // Everything
  )[]

  // Response
  status: 'pending' | 'fulfilled' | 'rejected' | 'partial'
  responseData?: ComplianceResponse
  fulfilledAt?: number
  rejectionReason?: string // "Invalid jurisdiction", "Insufficient legal basis"
}

interface ComplianceResponse {
  // Covenant data
  covenantSigner?: `0x${string}`
  covenantSignedAt?: number
  covenantHash?: `0x${string}`

  // Meta address data
  stealthMetaAddress?: string
  derivedAddresses?: `0x${string}`[] // All known stealth addresses

  // Transaction data
  poolDeposits?: PoolDeposit[]
  poolWithdrawals?: PoolWithdrawal[]
  portTransfers?: PortTransfer[]
}
```

### Compliance Levels

| Level         | Privacy                        | When Applied                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Normal**    | Full privacy from public       | Default for all users             |
| **Flagged**   | Monitored, no action yet       | Shipwreck report pending          |
| **Frozen**    | Can't withdraw from pool       | Confirmed bad actor               |
| **Disclosed** | Identity revealed to requester | Valid law enforcement request     |
| **Public**    | Identity published             | Court order for public disclosure |

### What Makes This Different From Nocturne

| Capability                 | Nocturne     | Galeon                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Covenant with EOA link** | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - signed with main wallet  |
| **Meta address registry**  | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - covenant stores it       |
| **Transaction tracing**    | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - Port/Pool records        |
| **Shipwreck reporting**    | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - community enforcement    |
| **Law enforcement API**    | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - formal process           |
| **Selective disclosure**   | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes - reveal one user, not all |
| **Pool survival**          | ❌ Shut down | ✅ Exclude bad actor, continue    |

## Why This Beats Tornado Cash

| Aspect                   | Tornado Cash            | Galeon Privacy Pools          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Entry**                | Anonymous               | Covenant required             |
| **Bad actors**           | Welcome                 | Excluded                      |
| **Reporting**            | None                    | Built-in Shipwreck            |
| **Regulatory status**    | Sanctioned              | Compliant by design           |
| **If bad actor found**   | Pool sanctioned         | Actor excluded, pool survives |
| **User accountability**  | Zero                    | Signed attestation            |
| **Privacy quality**      | Maximum (all mixed)     | High (good actors only)       |
| **Sustainability**       | Dead (sanctioned)       | Alive (self-policing)         |
| **Law enforcement**      | No cooperation possible | Full cooperation capability   |
| **Selective disclosure** | Impossible              | Target one user, not all      |

### The Key Insight

> Tornado Cash was sanctioned because it couldn't exclude bad actors **or cooperate with law enforcement**.
>
> Galeon can exclude bad actors **and** reveal identities when legally required.
>
> Users get privacy from the public. Law enforcement gets cooperation. The pool survives.

### On-Chain Verification

**Port-Only Deposits** (GaleonRegistry v2):

```solidity
// GaleonRegistry tracks stealth addresses when payments are made
mapping(address => bool) public isPortStealthAddress;

// Updated in payNative/payToken:
isPortStealthAddress[stealthAddress] = true;

// Pool queries this:
require(galeonRegistry.isValidPortAddress(msg.sender), "Must deposit from Port");
```

**Fog Wallet Withdrawals** (Pool contract):

```solidity
// Users must register their Fog wallet address before withdrawing
function registerWithdrawalAddress(
    address stealthAddress,
    bytes calldata ephemeralPubKey,  // 33 bytes, compressed
    bytes1 viewTag
) external {
    require(ephemeralPubKey[0] == 0x02 || ephemeralPubKey[0] == 0x03);
    isValidWithdrawalAddress[stealthAddress] = true;
}

// Pool enforces (ensures withdrawal goes to a valid Fog wallet):
require(isValidWithdrawalAddress[recipient], "Must withdraw to Fog wallet");
```

**ZK Proof Structure (Groth16):**

```
Private Inputs (known only to prover):
├── nullifier         (random 32 bytes, part of commitment)
├── secret            (random 32 bytes, part of commitment)
├── pathElements[20]  (Merkle proof siblings)
├── pathIndices[20]   (left/right path indicators)
└── aspPathElements   (ASP membership proof)

Public Inputs (visible to verifier/contract):
├── root              (Merkle root)
├── aspRoot           (Association set root)
├── nullifierHash     (Poseidon(nullifier))
├── recipient         (withdrawal address)
├── relayer           (relayer address)
└── relayerFee        (relayer compensation)

Circuit proves:
1. commitment = Poseidon(nullifier, secret)
2. commitment is in Merkle tree at root
3. commitment is in ASP valid set at aspRoot
4. nullifierHash = Poseidon(nullifier)

The commitment is NEVER revealed - ZK proves it exists without showing which one.

## ZK Circuit Specification

### Withdrawal Circuit

**Private Inputs:**

- `secret` - Random value known only to depositor
- `nullifier` - Random value for preventing double-spend
- `pathElements` - Merkle proof elements for deposit tree
- `pathIndices` - Merkle proof path (0 = left, 1 = right)
- `aspPathElements` - Merkle proof elements for ASP tree
- `aspPathIndices` - ASP merkle proof path

**Public Inputs:**

- `depositRoot` - Current deposit merkle root
- `aspRoot` - ASP's association set merkle root
- `nullifierHash` - Hash of nullifier (public for double-spend prevention)
- `recipient` - Withdrawal address

**Constraints:**

```
1. commitment = hash(secret, nullifier)
2. nullifierHash = hash(nullifier)
3. MerkleProof(commitment, pathElements, pathIndices) == depositRoot
4. MerkleProof(commitment, aspPathElements, aspPathIndices) == aspRoot
```

```

**Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Circuit compiles with circom
- [ ] Proof generation works in browser (<30s)
- [ ] Proof verification on-chain succeeds
- [ ] Invalid proofs are rejected

#### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (2-3 days)

**Files to create:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/web/contexts/pool-context.tsx` | Pool state + operations |
| `apps/web/hooks/use-pool-deposit.ts` | Deposit from Port |
| `apps/web/hooks/use-pool-withdraw.ts` | ZK proof + withdraw |
| `apps/web/lib/zk-prover.ts` | snarkjs integration |
| `apps/web/components/pool/deposit-modal.tsx` | Deposit UI |
| `apps/web/components/pool/withdraw-modal.tsx` | Withdraw UI |
| `apps/web/components/pool/pool-status-card.tsx` | Pool stats |

**Checkpoints:**

- [ ] User can deposit from Port UI
- [ ] Note (secret + nullifier) stored encrypted in localStorage
- [ ] User can see pending deposits + anonymity set size
- [ ] User can register withdrawal stealth address
- [ ] ZK proof generation in browser works
- [ ] User can withdraw with valid proof
- [ ] Full flow works end-to-end

#### Phase 4: Note Management (1 day)

**Note storage (like Tornado Cash):**

```typescript
interface PoolNote {
  currency: 'MNT'
  amount: string
  netId: number // Chain ID
  commitment: `0x${string}`
  nullifier: `0x${string}`
  secret: `0x${string}`
  leafIndex: number
  depositedAt: number
}

// Serialized format for backup
// galeon-mnt-1-0x<commitment>-0x<nullifier>-0x<secret>

// Encrypted in localStorage with session key
const POOL_NOTES_KEY = 'galeon-pool-notes-{address}'
```

**Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Notes encrypted at rest
- [ ] Backup/export flow works
- [ ] Note format is portable

#### Phase 5: Testing & Deploy (2 days)

**Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Deposit from Port succeeds
- [ ] Deposit from non-Port fails
- [ ] Withdrawal with valid proof succeeds
- [ ] Withdrawal with invalid proof fails
- [ ] Double-spend (same nullifier) fails
- [ ] Invalid root fails
- [ ] Stealth address registration works
- [ ] Full flow: Port → Pool → Fog → Pay
- [ ] Testnet deployment verified

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `PoolDepositModal.tsx`    | Deposit from Port to Pool                |
| `PoolWithdrawModal.tsx`   | Withdraw from Pool to Fog                |
| `PoolStatusCard.tsx`      | Show pool stats (deposits, your pending) |
| `PrivacyPoolProvider.tsx` | Context for pool state                   |

## Data Types

### New Types in `types/fog.ts`

```typescript
// Privacy Pool types
export interface PoolDeposit {
  id: string
  commitment: `0x${string}`
  note: string // Encrypted note for user
  leafIndex: number
  depositedAt: number
  txHash: `0x${string}`
  sourcePortIndex?: number // If deposited from Port
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'spent'
}

export interface PoolWithdrawal {
  id: string
  nullifierHash: `0x${string}`
  recipient: `0x${string}` // Direct to recipient - no intermediate address
  amount: string
  withdrawnAt: number
  txHash: `0x${string}`
  aspUsed: `0x${string}`
}

export interface PoolStats {
  totalDeposits: number
  totalWithdrawals: number
  pendingDeposits: number // Yours
  anonymitySet: number // Current unique deposits
  aspRoot: `0x${string}`
  lastUpdated: number
}

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

| Threat                | Mitigation                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Double-spend          | Nullifier tracking on-chain                      |
| Fake proofs           | Groth16 ZK verification                          |
| Deposit front-running | Commitment hash hides secret                     |
| ASP censorship        | Multiple approved ASPs                           |
| ASP collusion         | ASP only sees deposit addresses, not withdrawals |
| Timing attacks        | 2hr auto-hop delay after withdrawal              |
| Amount correlation    | Fixed 1 MNT denomination                         |

### What Galeon ASP Knows

| Data                        | Visible?              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Deposit address             | ✅ Yes                |
| Deposit amount              | ✅ Yes (always 1 MNT) |
| Deposit commitment          | ✅ Yes                |
| Withdrawal address          | ❌ No (only on-chain) |
| Which deposit was withdrawn | ❌ No (ZK proof)      |
| User identity               | ❌ No                 |

### What On-Chain Observers Know

| Data                              | Visible?                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Someone deposited                 | ✅ Yes                      |
| Someone withdrew                  | ✅ Yes                      |
| Link between deposit & withdrawal | ❌ No                       |
| Deposit from sanctioned address   | ✅ Yes (but can't withdraw) |

### v1 Remaining Limitations (0xbow Fork)

Even with the 0xbow fork providing ZK proofs, some limitations remain:

| Issue                              | Description                                                                                          | Mitigation                               | Future Improvement              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Gas payment for registration**   | `registerWithdrawalAddress()` must be called from some EOA that pays gas, creating linkable metadata | Call from Port address before depositing | Add relayer in v2               |
| **Stealth registration is public** | `WithdrawalAddressRegistered` events reveal which addresses are Galeon Fog wallets                   | Not a security issue, just metadata      | Relayer hides this              |
| **Note backup critical**           | If user loses localStorage, funds are stuck forever                                                  | Force backup confirmation, export option | Backend-encrypted backup option |
| **Centralized ban list**           | Owner-controlled ban list could be abused                                                            | Transparent on-chain, multi-sig owner    | DAO governance + multi-ASP      |
| **Port-only deposit restriction**  | Only Port addresses can deposit (by design)                                                          | Feature not bug - ensures covenant       | Optional external deposits v2   |
| **Single denomination**            | Fixed 1 MNT per deposit                                                                              | Multiple deposits for larger amounts     | Multi-denomination pools v2     |
| **Proof generation time**          | ZK proof takes 10-30s in browser                                                                     | Web worker, progress indicator           | WASM optimization, mobile       |

### v1 Gas Payment Flow

**Who pays gas for what:**

| Action                        | Who Calls            | Who Pays Gas     | Privacy Implication             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `deposit()`                   | Port stealth address | Port (has funds) | ✅ OK - Port already public     |
| `registerWithdrawalAddress()` | Port address         | Port (has funds) | ✅ OK - done before deposit     |
| `withdraw()`                  | Any EOA              | Caller           | ⚠️ Links gas payer to recipient |

**Recommended flow for maximum privacy:**

1. Generate Fog wallet address client-side
2. Call `registerWithdrawalAddress()` from the Port address (has funds)
3. Call `deposit()` from the Port address
4. Wait for anonymity set to grow
5. Generate ZK proof in browser
6. Call `withdraw()` from a fresh burner EOA (funded via CEX)

**v2 Improvement:** Relayer network will allow gas-free `registerWithdrawalAddress()` and `withdraw()` calls.

### Galeon-Specific Modifications

**1. Port-Only Deposits (Stricter than 0xbow)**

0xbow allows any address to deposit, relying on ASP to filter bad actors post-deposit. Galeon adds an additional layer:

```
0xbow:   Anyone → Pool → ASP filters → Withdrawal
Galeon:  Port only → Pool → ASP + Ban list → Fog wallet (stealth-only)
```

This means all deposits are from covenant signers - "clean by design."

**2. Stealth-Only Withdrawals (Stricter than 0xbow)**

0xbow allows withdrawal to any address. Galeon requires registration of Fog wallet addresses with ephemeral key validation, ensuring:

- Withdrawals go to proper stealth addresses
- On-chain audit trail for compliance
- No accidental withdrawal to traceable addresses

### v1 Compliance Status (0xbow Fork)

## Compliance Enforcement System

### Why `commitmentDepositor` is Required

The Pool must track which stealth address deposited each commitment. This gives Galeon **freeze authority** without **surveillance capability**.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Doesn't Reduce ZK Privacy

The ZK proof structure preserves privacy even with `commitmentDepositor`:

```
Deposit:
  commitment = hash(nullifier, secret)
  → commitment is PUBLIC (stored in tree)
  → nullifier + secret are PRIVATE (only user knows)

Withdraw:
  User proves: "I know (nullifier, secret) such that hash(nullifier, secret) is in the tree"
  → Reveals: nullifierHash (to prevent double-spend)
  → Does NOT reveal: which commitment, or the secret
```

**The missing link for tracing:**

| Galeon Knows                     | Galeon Doesn't Know                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Commitment X belongs to User A   | The nullifier for commitment X        |
| User B withdrew with nullifier N | Which commitment produced nullifier N |

Without the `secret`, we cannot compute: `commitment → nullifier`. So even with `commitmentDepositor`:

- "User A deposited commitment X" ✅
- "Someone withdrew using nullifier N" ✅
- **Cannot prove:** "User A made this withdrawal" ❌

**Summary:**

> `commitmentDepositor` = **freeze authority** without **surveillance capability**
>
> ZK protects the deposit → withdrawal link. These are orthogonal.

### Amount-Limited Deposits (Dusting Attack Prevention)

**Problem:** Bad actor could send dirty funds directly to a valid Port stealth address, then the Port owner unknowingly deposits "dirty" funds to the Pool.

**Solution:** Only allow deposits up to the amount verified through GaleonRegistry.

```solidity
// Track verified amounts per stealth address (from GaleonRegistry payments)
mapping(address => uint256) public verifiedBalance;

// Called by GaleonRegistry after payment
function recordVerifiedPayment(address stealthAddress, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(galeonRegistry), "Only registry");
    verifiedBalance[stealthAddress] += amount;
}

function deposit(bytes32 commitment) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Zero deposit");
    require(verifiedBalance[msg.sender] >= msg.value, "Exceeds verified balance");

    // Deduct from verified balance (prevents double-deposit)
    verifiedBalance[msg.sender] -= msg.value;

    // Track depositor for compliance
    commitmentDepositor[commitment] = msg.sender;
    commitmentAmount[commitment] = msg.value;

    // ... rest of deposit logic
}
```

This ensures:

1. Only funds that came through GaleonRegistry can enter the Pool
2. Direct sends to stealth addresses cannot be deposited
3. Dusting attacks are ineffective

**Key Insight:** The Pool is the "privacy firewall":

- **Before Pool**: Full traceability (viewing keys)
- **After Pool**: No traceability (ZK)

### Frozen Fund Recovery System

Frozen funds shouldn't be wasted. The system provides appeal + treasury recovery:

```solidity
// Exclusion with metadata
struct Exclusion {
    bool excluded;
    uint256 excludedAt;
    uint256 amount;
    address depositor;
}

mapping(bytes32 => Exclusion) public exclusions;
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public frozenClaimed;

uint256 public constant APPEAL_PERIOD = 30 days;
address public treasury;

// ASP excludes a commitment (freeze)
function excludeCommitment(bytes32 commitment) external onlyASP {
    require(commitmentDepositor[commitment] != address(0), "Unknown commitment");

    exclusions[commitment] = Exclusion({
        excluded: true,
        excludedAt: block.timestamp,
        amount: commitmentAmount[commitment],
        depositor: commitmentDepositor[commitment]
    });

    emit CommitmentExcluded(commitment, commitmentDepositor[commitment]);
}

// ASP removes exclusion (appeal successful)
function removeExclusion(bytes32 commitment) external onlyASP {
    require(exclusions[commitment].excluded, "Not excluded");

    exclusions[commitment].excluded = false;
    emit ExclusionRemoved(commitment);
    // User can now withdraw normally
}

// ASP claims frozen funds after appeal period
function claimFrozenFunds(bytes32 commitment) external onlyASP {
    Exclusion memory exc = exclusions[commitment];

    require(exc.excluded, "Not excluded");
    require(block.timestamp >= exc.excludedAt + APPEAL_PERIOD, "Appeal period active");
    require(!frozenClaimed[commitment], "Already claimed");

    frozenClaimed[commitment] = true;

    (bool success, ) = treasury.call{value: exc.amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");

    emit FrozenFundsClaimed(commitment, exc.amount);

**Trade-off:**

- No KYC → More users, less friction, but post-withdraw is "wallet address only"
- KYC → Fewer users, more friction, but full legal recourse post-withdraw

For hackathon: Tier 1 is sufficient. KYC can be added for institutional/regulated use cases in v2.

## Contract Upgradeability

### Why Upgradeable Contracts

| Reason                 | Explanation                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Privacy Pools v2**   | 0xbow launching shielded pools March 2026 - need to integrate |
| **Bug fixes**          | ZK circuits and compliance logic may need updates             |
| **Feature additions**  | KYC, multi-denomination, ERC20, relayers                      |
| **Compliance updates** | Regulations will evolve                                       |

### Upgrade Pattern: UUPS

All core contracts should use OpenZeppelin's UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard):

```solidity
// Example: GaleonRegistryV1.sol
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";

contract GaleonRegistryV1 is
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
    // Replace immutables with regular state
    IERC5564Announcer public announcer;
    IERC6538Registry public registry;

    // Storage gap for future upgrades (50 slots)
    uint256[50] private __gap;

    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }

    function initialize(
        address _announcer,
        address _registry,
        address _owner
    ) public initializer {
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        announcer = IERC5564Announcer(_announcer);
        registry = IERC6538Registry(_registry);
    }

    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
        internal
        override
        onlyOwner
    {}
}
```

### Contracts to Make Upgradeable

| Contract                   | Priority | Migration Notes                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GaleonRegistry**         | High     | Replace `immutable` with state vars, add `initialize()` |
| **GaleonPrivacyPool**      | High     | ZK verifier can be upgraded separately                  |
| **GaleonCovenantRegistry** | Medium   | Future KYC integration                                  |

### Storage Layout Rules

1. **Never remove or reorder existing storage variables**
2. **Always add new variables at the end**
3. **Use storage gaps (`uint256[50] private __gap`) for future additions**
4. **Document storage layout in comments**

### Upgrade Governance

For hackathon: Owner-controlled upgrades (simple)
For production: Consider timelocks or multisig:

```solidity
// Future: TimelockController for upgrades
ITimelockController public upgradeTimelock;
uint256 public constant UPGRADE_DELAY = 2 days;

function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override {
    require(
        upgradeTimelock.isOperationReady(keccak256(abi.encode(newImplementation))),
        "Upgrade not scheduled or not ready"
    );
}
```

## Open Questions (Mostly Resolved)

1. ~~**Denomination**: Fixed 1 MNT or multiple tiers (0.1, 1, 10)?~~ → Fixed 1 MNT for v1
2. ~~**Relayer**: Add relayer for gas-free withdrawals?~~ → Deferred to v2
3. ~~**Multiple pools**: One pool or separate by denomination?~~ → Single pool for v1
4. ~~**Note storage**: LocalStorage vs backend vs user responsibility?~~ → Encrypted localStorage
5. ~~**ASP decentralization**: Start with Galeon-only or add others?~~ → Galeon-only for v1
6. ~~**ZK vs Commit-Reveal**: Use ZK proofs or simpler approach?~~ → ZK (0xbow fork)
